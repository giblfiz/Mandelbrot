1) Unit tests? I'm not entirely sure how to do this  !!ha ha, I can look at specific pixels!
*2) nicer colors ... (Some work done... looks like it will depend on bigInt to look right)
3) DONE!! Multi-pass drawing for greater responsiveness (could do odd/even or many other things, how do you flush to canvas anyway?)
4) Use canvas for quick-scaling and quick-movement
5) make movement "dragable" rather than clickable (mandelbrot math code is now in place for this)
6) Use BigInt library so it's able to go deeper 
7) REFACTOR!!! 
      DONE  --Clear out globals
  --Clean up formulas
  --JS lint
  --use a closure for color interpreter
8) DONE  make zoom&pan set and respect anchor tags (so views can be bookmarked)
9) tune for speed

10) DONE!!  Chunk itterations so FF & other browsers don't hang
11) Create the "video zoom out" effect
