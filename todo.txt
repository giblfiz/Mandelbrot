1) Unit tests? I'm not entirely sure how to do this
2) nicer colors
3) Multi-pass drawing for greater responsiveness (could do odd/even or many other things)
4) Use canvas for quick-scaling and quick-movement
5) make movement "dragable" rather than clickable
6) Use BigInt library so its faster
7) REFACTOR!!! 
  --Clear out globals
  --Clean up formulas
  --JS lint
  --use a closure for color interpreter
8) make zoom&pan set and respect anchor tags (so views can be bookmarked)
9) tune for speed
